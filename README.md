# Mini Holiday Hackathon 2024

A nostalgic web project created for the Mini Holiday Hackathon 2024, designed to transport visitors back to the pre-social-media internet era. The site features classic web elements including a trail cursor, festive backgrounds, and visitor counting functionality.

## 💭 Project Vision

**Now, It's Personal**

This hackathon theme IS personal. It gave me all feels of pre-billionaires-want-all-of-your-data-and-algorithms-rule-your-feed era, before "influencers" and "content-creators" were job titles.

I hope that my site gives you nostalgia for a time you may have never experienced, or gives you a flood of memories.

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

1. **Universal Access**: Mobile responsive while maintaining the authentic experience of a site built for a square screen, left-aligned - just like we all used on desktop back in the day.
2. **Personal Touch**: Added personal pictures for maximum nostalgia & authenticity.
3. **Classic Aesthetics**: Intentionally used Comic Sans (for the haters!) and vibrant colors while maintaining retro blue & grey system aesthetics.
